### Speak, Memory
- **By.** Vladimir Nabokov
- **Notes.** His style of writing is impeccable, as always. But if you want to learn more about the author's life, you are in for a disappointment. The kind of background information one would ordinarily find in a biography is omitted. VN writes for himself and no one else.

### The Elements of Murder: A History of Poison
- **By.** John Emsley
- **Notes.** The first chapter was alright. But the book did get quite repetitive after a while.

### The Mandarins
- **By.** Simone de Beauvoir
- **Notes.** Hats off. The plot is very Hemingwayesque. However, this novel was not dry as, say, *A Moveable Feast* or *The Sun Also Rises*. SB writes so well! The dialogues, which make up the meat of the novel, are fascinating. Moreover, this is not just a novel about fashionable people living novel-like lives; it is also a novel about post-war Paris and communism. A remarkable book.
