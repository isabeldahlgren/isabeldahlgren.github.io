I've dabbled with various code editors: VScode, the JetBrains editors, Atom, etc. A while ago, I tried out Vim. I'd gotten stuck in the program so many times that I thought it was high time to learn it. So I looked up all the keybindings, installed a new colorscheme and got myself a bunch of plugins. In order to build muscle memory, I started using Vim for coding, LaTex and email-writing. 

The main selling point of Vim, I guess, is that it's faster. People who have been vimming for long can edit code at a remarkable speed. Admittedly, there's quite a steep learning curve. I'm certainly not fluent in Vim yet. However, I daresay learning Vim is well worth the investment. If you can shave off one second every time you uncomment a block of code, you'll have more time to think about the stuff that actually needs thinking. But Vim is also faster in another sense: the start up time is almost $0$. In contrast, VSCode may easily take $5-10$ seconds, especially if you have many plugins. If you just want to make some minor touches to a file, you may not need a full-blown editor. In contrast, Vim starts instantly, even if you're a beginner. And should you want to, you can make Vim nearly as powerful as VScode by means of plugins.

Hardly no one uses plain vanilla Vim. In fact, when you first open Vim, you'll find that the backspace key doesn't work as expected. There are no line numbers. The coloscheme puts you off. No wonder people are appalled by Vim. Yet, you can customise Vim to your own taste. You can build your configuration from scratch, or you can get started by using someone else's config. In fact, you can turn Vim into a fully-fledged editor by cloning a repo. At first, I used Vim to typeset my homework in LaTex. So I copied a minimal Vim config file, then I added the plugin used for compiling LaTex documents. I built my config piecemeal, adding one feature at a time. That way, I didn't get the redundant features of other editors.

However, the most pleasing aspect of using Vim is that it gives you a self-confidence boost. It makes you feel like a tech handy-man. This meant a lot to me. Up until then, I'd never considered myself technically savvy (or a man, for that matter). This, in turn, encouraged me to learn more about how the computer actually works, which made programming much more enjoyable. I believe many people lose interest in programming because they run into trivial issues, of the "command not found" kind. Despite there being quick fixes to such problems, they take up a lot of time, and they're rather annoying. Once I'd learned some Vim, I picked up Bash scripting, and I installed a few terminal CLI apps. And down the rabbit hole I went...

At this point, it's unlikely that I'll switch editor anytime soon. In part, it's sunk cost fallacy. But Vim certainly has many merits, and it fits into my overall workflow.
