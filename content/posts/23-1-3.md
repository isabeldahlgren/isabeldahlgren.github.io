### The Gene
- **By.** Siddhartha Mukherjee.
- **Rating.** 4/5.
- **Notes.** Very well-written book. S.M. focuses on the interplay between science and society. Alarming to see how science is driven by personal feuds and political interests. I liked *The Emperor of All Maladies* better.

### I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings
- **By.** Maya Angelou.
- **Notes.** A lovely little book. M.A. has seen so much. She has lots of things to tell. The language is flowery, but not pretentious. It's as much of an autobiography as a portrait of an era. Makes you appreciate how quickly things have evolved. I became quite attached to the characters. They're hardly successful by society's standards, but they show how much a human being can be.
