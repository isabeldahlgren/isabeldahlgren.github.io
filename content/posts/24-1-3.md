### Superforecasting
- **By.** Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner.
- **Rating.** 3/5.
- **Notes.** A thought-provoking book. PT briefly describes his study on expert political judgement, and then argues that forecasting is a trainable skill. For a summary on how to make better forecasts, see the end of chapter 8. I was thinking a bit about why superforecasters don't receive more attention. This was a good read, although the last few chapters felt a bit superfluous.

### Letters to a Young Poet
- **By.** Rainer Maria Rilke.
- **Notes.** Letters to Franz Xaver Kappus. What a book. The writing is "dense". It will take a while (a lifetime) to appreciate most passages. I was thinking a lot about RMR's personality. All letters are so affectionate.
