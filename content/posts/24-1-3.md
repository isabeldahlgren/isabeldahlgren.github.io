### Letters to a Young Poet
- **By.** Rainer Maria Rilke.
- **Notes.** Letters to Franz Xaver Kappus. What a book. Just like everyone else, I liked the sixth chapter best. This book is dense, and very quotable. It will take a while (a lifetime) to appreciate most passages. I was thinking a lot about RMR's personality. All letters are so affectionate. It's almost as if RMR is writing love letters to a stranger.
