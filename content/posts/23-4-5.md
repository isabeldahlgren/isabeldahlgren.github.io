### The World of Yesterday
- **By.** Stefan Zweig.
- **When.** 1942.
- **Notes.** A hommage to Europe and its people. One gets the impression that SZ is already an angel when writing. This book is unique.

### Darkness at Noon
- **By.** Arthur Koestler.
- **When.** 1940.
- **Notes.** Just as any good dystopia, this book was disturbing. Because the entire novel takes place inside a prison, I found this book more disturbing than *1984* and *Brave New World*.
