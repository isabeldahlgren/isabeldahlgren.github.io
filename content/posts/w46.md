Now that I'm nearing the end of my studies, I've reflected a lot on the value of having a tight-knit community, as you always hear recent graduates say they miss the sense of community from college.

I'm mainly interested in communities sharing most aspects of life, ranging from professional to personal -- the urban analogue of a [kibbutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz); I'll call such communities 'life circles'. Life circles involve standing social events, often at a third space, and its members share a sense of community.

Life circles arise naturally within some Eastern cultures, where they're usually centered around the family unit, though you'll also find life circles among creatives, entrepreneurs and other people 'with character' in the West. Examples of life circles in the West include [Arcadia](https://joinarcadia.org), [Emerge Lakefront](https://emergelakefront.org) and [Feytopia](https://feytopia.com). However, a circle doesn't need to entail co-living: [Fractal](https://fractalnyc.com) is just a housing network.

Having a life circle gives you a professional edge. Political, artistic and scientific movements are collective endeavours, and they cannot be carried out by a single person, however smart. Famous examples of life circles include the Bloomsbury group and the Vienna Circle. Similarly, you cannot successfully run a company without having some very good friends -- not just coffee-machine acquaintances, but friends you can rely on no matter what. There's a real sense, then, in which world history wasn't shaped by individuals, but by groups of individuals. 

But above all, feeling a sense of belonging is important for overall life satisfaction, and a life circle provides just that.

Of course -- you don't need a life circle to live well: you can have different friendship groups for the various areas of your life. This creates more overhead, though, and requires you to be both agentic and good with people (I'm neither).

Though Stockholm has among the highest proportions of one-person households in the world (a staggering [60%](https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness))[^not-lonely], there are several life circle initiatives here. The startup ecosystem finds itself in a chicken-egg relationship with life circles, and there are various innovation hubs with life circle vibes: [A House](https://ahouse.se/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21793326861&gbraid=0AAAAACahM7xx1yNHuwh_dKKlZ70xHr_CN&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvOjKBhC9ARIsAFvz5lhQHxEN6Gzcl7AzVB_r5oLElQcMJo3m1UrBqNTUc8QMryIIu7IIGSYaAno-EALw_wcB), [Knackeriet](https://www.knackeriet.se), [Alma](https://www.thisisalma.com), [Norrsken](https://www.norrsken.org/houses/stockholm), [Slottsbacken](https://helio.se/sv/slottsbacken/). There are also co-living communities like [Emerge Lakefront](https://emergelakefront.org), [K9](https://www.k9coliving.com) and [Udda](https://www.udda.co) (more examples [here](https://www.visitstockholm.com/live-work/your-life-stockholm/co-living-in-stockholm-i-wish-this-was-my-starting-point/)).

More broadly, it's worth mentioning the student apartments and co-living spaces of Stockholms studentbostäder (SSSB), which provide natural meeting hubs for students and young professionals. There's also a long-standing [tradition of study circles in Sweden](https://anekdot.se/bildningspoddavsnitt/32-studiecirkeln-live/), some of which also have a life circle ring to them.

[^not-lonely]: This doesn't translate into higher rates of loneliness, though. In [one study](https://ourworldindata.org/lonely-not-alone), self-reported rates of loneliness among older adults were the lowest in Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden, and the highest in Greece, Israel and Italy.

Soon-to-be graduates find themselves somewhere between communities based around student apartments and exclusive co-working spaces. If you don't want to live in a shared apartment, you're not part of a life circle by default. Or even if you have access to an exclusive co-working space, perhaps you wish to be part of a more diverse community. And there's no obvious life circle in Stockholm for such people. Problem.

Partial solution (feel free to submit your own solutions [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxJtKLMFqQka14yyiZbqlHpGp27A-7ei6tvMn8HaDLJVUqIg/viewform?usp=publish-editor)): for a start, you could create a Luma calendar with friends with both standing events and casual one-offs -- see e.g. the [calendar of Fractal Geneva](https://luma.com/fractalgva). I imagine people adding their own events (casual dinners, vibe-coding afternoons, museum visits), as well as events they plan on attending (seminars, plays, concerts). Subscribers of the Luma calendar will then be notified when someone adds an event and can mark whether they'll join. In addition to the calendar, maybe a group chat. This would be something like a minimal, low-effort life circle[^fractal] -- an easy way to foster some sense of community[^chat].

[^chat]: You could do the event managing through the group chat. However, group chats don't scale as well, and they don't allow for the automatic creation of recurring events. Oh, and you're also missing out on the beautiful Luma interface. Discord would work well for life circles, though it's a very nerd-coded platform.

I just created a calendar; let me know if I should add you. 

*This post was inspired by conversations with Agatha Duzan, Elias Koschier, Chiara Gerosa, Konrad Seifert and Åke Lindblom.*

[^fractal]: I'm hesitant to call it a proper Fractal because it wouldn't involve members living at a walking distance from one another. This is more like community building for the lazy.
