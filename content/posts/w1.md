Here are some of my favourite German learning resources:

- [*Nicos Weg*](https://learngerman.dw.com/de/nicos-weg/c-36519718): An engaging, comprehensive German course, all for free.
- *NE:s lilla tyska ordbok*: Because everyone needs a good physical dictionary.
- *Den tyska grammatiken*: Very very helpful, in that it contrasts Swedish grammar with German grammar.
- *Unfassbar*: A documantary-style podcast. Very bingeable.
- *Wild Wild web*: Stories about, well, the Internet. A mixture of true crime, personal stories and trivia.
- *Einschlafen mit Wikipedia*: The low (sleep inducing) speaking pace is perfect for language learners.
- *Easy German*: Excellent for A1-B1 learners.
