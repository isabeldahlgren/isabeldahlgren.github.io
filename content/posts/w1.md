Here is a quick rundown of some of my favourite German learning resources. 

### Books
- *NE:s lilla tyska ordbok*: Because everyone needs a good dictionary.
- *Den tyska grammatiken*: Very very helpful, in that it contrasts Swedish grammar with German grammar.

### Podcasts
- *Unfassbar*: A documantary-style podcast. Very bingeable.
- *Einschlafen mit Wikipedia*: The low (sleep inducing) speaking pace is perfect for language learners.
- *Easy German*: Excellent for A1-B1 learners.

### Miscellaneous
- [*Nicos Weg*](https://learngerman.dw.com/de/nicos-weg/c-36519718): An engaging, comprehensive German course, all for free.
