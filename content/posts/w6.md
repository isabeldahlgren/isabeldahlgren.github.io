Random people on the Internet have played a huge role in my education. I'm not just referring to my coursework at university, but also about life-long learning. I regularly visit sites like Quanta Magazine, StackOverflow and Paul Graham's blog: both for kindling my curiosity, as well as getting unstuck. But I've probably derived the most value from just watching YouTube.

Above all, there's some top notch content out there. Nowadays there are full-time YouTubers, working on creating professional, meticulously edited videos. And some channels, such as [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q), are even ran by entire teams of illustrators and script-writers. I think the number of heartfelt comments to some of these videos illustrates just how good some of these videos are. For example, here are some comments from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) videos:

> "I dropped out in 10th grade 25 years ago and your videos have inspired me to go back to school."

> "You sir truly deserve an honorary doctorate - just for this video. Your impact to generations of confused engineering and math students will forever ripple through our society."

> "I have a master's degree in mechanical engineering and I'm starting to think I should redo my whole education from ground up searching for this kind of intuitive knowledge. It's absurd that I find out explanations which are as intuitive as this one so late in my life. I'm blown away completely! I mean how many bits of information have we stumbled upon during our formal education failing to see how they elegantly relate to each other and form a bigger picture...oh my!"

Moreover, videos are good at capturing your attention. Although most people are unable to read while doing a cycling workout, they can watch videos. Something incredible happens when you combine visuals with audio. Getting started learning has never required less willpower - just search "Introduction to..." on YouTube.

Still, sometimes I end up doomscrolling through shorts. YouTube does try maximising user retention, after all. So how do we optimise for a better user experience?

- **Mediaplayer plugin**: This Obsidian plugin has been a real game changer for me. It allows you to watch YouTube videos from inside Obsidian and take notes with timestamps.
- **Train your algorithm**: In your YouTube feed, take 2 seconds to press "Not interested" whenever something irrelevant pops up. It pays off - I find the YouTube algorithm to be surprisingly sensitive to my feedback.[^1]
- **Keep separate accounts**: On a similar note, I have two Google accounts: my main account, and my secondary account. I'll use my main account for watching "useful" content, while I'll log onto my secondary account for, well, everything else. 
- **Rewatch your faves**: It's easy ending up only consuming new content, just because the YouTube landing page is filled with new videos. But it's worth saving your favourite videos to playlists and rewatching them later.
- **Block channels**: One can use [ColdTurkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/support/how-to/allow-youtube-channel/) to block certain YouTube channels.

Of course, there's a reason we don't abandon more traditional media altogether. YouTube has its limitations. First, even if you make the tweaks described above, the user interface is still full of distractions. Also, when reading a book, I find it much easier recognising when I'm confused. However, after finishing a video, I sometimes find myself completely bamboozled and unable to tell where I got lost.

That said, I think there are ways to get around some of these problems. Surely YouTube could develop distraction-free mode, enabling the user to remove shorts, ads or sponsored content. It seems doable, at least from a technical perspective. But we could also go beyond just ordinary videos. For example, Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen have explored ways of incorporating an element of spaced repetition in videos, making for a more interactive learning experience[^2]. All in all, I'm very excited about the possibilities of integrating modern technology in education. Lastly, I'd like to thank all my teachers out there.
