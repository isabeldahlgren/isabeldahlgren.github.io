Many textbooks are written in a terse style. When reading these kinds of texts, I find it helpful to ask: "What would the insufferably wordy version of this text look like?" This is all about reading proactively, but in a very concrete way. Typically, this involves doing either one of two things:

- Expanding on definitions: Can we rephrase the definition? Why do we care about this concept? Is there a handwavy, more intuitive definition? Consider, for example, the definition of a homeomorphism. We say a map $f : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism if it is continuous, bijective and open. If we wish to elaborate on this, we might say that a homeomorphism preserves the structures of the topological spaces $X$ and $Y$. Thus, if we can find a homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$, they are the "roughly the same".
- Motivating proofs in minute detail: What is the big picture? Are we on the course for a contradiction, or will we have to consider each case separately? How do the assumptions go into this proof? Ideally, one should be able to reverse-engineer the solution.

The main point is, of course, to engage with the material. But whereas "Read proactively" is a very general piece of advice, it might be easier visualising the would-be 1000-page version of the text.
