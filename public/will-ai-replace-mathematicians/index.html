    </header><p>I used to think of maths as the one thing LLMs couldn&rsquo;t do well. While GPT 3.0 would excel in language-based tasks, it would struggle to solve elementary maths problems. But a lot has happened since then. Over the last year, I&rsquo;ve come to take the idea of using AI as an aid for doing maths more seriously. In fact, I now believe LLMs might prove new theorems with no human guidance within just 3 years.</p>
<p>First, there was the silver medal at International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Although AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 took well over 9h, the time given contestants are given, it&rsquo;s quite a feat: IMO problems require an element of creativity. Not only that - it was able to formalise its solution in Lean. Lean is still a fairly new programming language, and there isn&rsquo;t nearly as much training data as for other programming languages. The work of the DeepMind team shows two things: firstly, lots of clever people are trying to build AI systems for doing maths; secondly, apparently their current approach works pretty well. However, as of April 2025, you don&rsquo;t need an AI specifically trained to do maths in order to solve tricky problems: the new o3 and o4 mini models achieve impressing performance in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. What if we use RL to build AI systems specialised in more advanced topics? Perhaps these AIs might prove new theorems. Even if they don&rsquo;t, they might provide researchers with insights.</p>
<p>Next, several top-gun mathematicians think AI might transform maths research in the next decade. Most notably, Terence Tao has highlighted ways in which machines can help human mathematicians. Here&rsquo;s Tao<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I could feed GPT-4 the first few PDF pages of a recent math preprint and get it to generate a half-dozen intelligent questions that an expert attending a talk on the preprint could ask. I plan to use variants of such prompts to prepare my future presentations or to begin reading a technically complex paper.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Richard Borcherds seems equally optimistic about the possibilities of using, predicting that AI might even surpass human mathematicians within 10 years<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Overall, I think we&rsquo;re starting to see a cultural shift in the maths community. People are recognising that AI is a huge deal.</p>
<p>Finally, I observed that 40% of students in the library seem to have a Chat-GPT tab open at all times. These are students doing STEM subjects, such as maths and physics. This seems like an important data point (and this isn&rsquo;t just because I&rsquo;m giving more weight to first-hand experience). LLMs are transforming the way students learn, and these are the people who will go on to do research in a couple of years. Chances are we won&rsquo;t stop using LLMs just because the material becomes more niche. Even if you receive a hallucinatory answer, the LLM might reference a relevant concept, helping you get unstuck. I&rsquo;m using Chat-GPT for my own studies, and I&rsquo;m impressed by its explaining abilities. Basically, it can easily handle any concept you&rsquo;ll come across in a master degree in mathematics. I&rsquo;ve also prompted Chat-GPT to distill the key ideas from more recent papers and found its responses very helpful.</p>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;ve come to shorten my AI timelines quite a bit. But rather than thinking &ldquo;Will I ever find a job?&rdquo;, I find myself thinking &ldquo;What a time to be alive!&rdquo;</p>
