    </header><p>Everyone who has ever lived abroad gets homesick every now and then.</p>
<p>Swedes, I give you a postcard from a Stockholm-centric, homesick expat. Non-Swedes, here&rsquo;s a highly biased tourist guide.</p>
<p>The best thing about Sweden? My favourite Swedes, for sure. I miss family and friends a lot.</p>
<p>Other than that, hearing Swedish jazz live. Hearing <em>Sakta vi gå genom stan</em> and <em>Flykten från vardagen</em> live. Or if Glenn Miller or Fasching is too pricey, you could just drop by KMH and enjoy up-and-coming jazz, all for free.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s all the traditional Swedish music. It&rsquo;s easier appreciating the music of Olle Adolfsson, Evert Taube and Cornelis Vreeswijk when you&rsquo;re in Sweden. I tried listening to some Swedish classics while abroad, but pieces like <em>Siv och Gunne</em> just seemed kitsch.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of gems in student song books. Student inside jokes are the best kinds of jokes. Many pieces aren&rsquo;t just witty, but also quite beautiful. Take <em>O Gamla Klang och Jubeltid</em>, for example.</p>
<p>In fact, only now have I come to appreciate Swedish student life. Valborg abroad was depressing. No Orphei Drängar, no champagne breakfast, no mösspåtagning. And to the best of my knowledge, you can&rsquo;t attend gasques outside of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also become a big fan of Stockholm architecture. I find many areas of Vasastan, Östermalm and Södermalm very pretty. For example, consider the areas around Engelbrektskyrkan and Mosebacke torg. While I know little about architecture, I think there aren&rsquo;t as many odd clashes between different architectural styles as in, say, Zürich or Berlin.</p>
<p>And ah, Scandinavian design! To be fair, Danish design is unparalleled. But Sweden also has a long tradition of good design. This means that your average interior design store has some really good stuff. In particular, you can get good design cheaply.</p>
<p>Maybe Scandinavian design is inspired by the water. In Stockholm, there&rsquo;s water everywhere. Most cities are built around rivers, so rivers don&rsquo;t really count. Stockholm is built on a little archipelago. It creates an entirely different city space.</p>
<p>For the best view of the water, head to Monteliusvägen and Ivar Los park. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like having picknick with friends in Ivar Los park on a summer evening, before cycling home on near-empty streets (July).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I miss sailing in the Stockholm archipelago. As a teen, I found it boring: stuck with parents for four weeks with no internet on a few square metres. But now I see the charm in it. Even the small, unknown islands might as well have been taken from a Zorn or Strindberg painting.</p>
<p>Finally, Swedish. Apart from friends and family, the aspect of Swedish life I miss the most is the language. I miss speaking Swedish.</p>
<p>There are so many lovely Swedish words that have no English analogue, besides the much-cited example of &ldquo;lagom&rdquo;. Consider &ldquo;killgissa&rdquo;. This literally means &ldquo;guy-guessing&rdquo;. Someone is guy-guessing when they sound knowledgeable but are really just bullshitting. Another gem: &ldquo;käpphäst&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;hobby horse&rdquo;. In a figurative sense, a hobby horse is an idea you keep on bringing up in social situations. Another useful expression: &ldquo;Nu är det dags att sätta punkt.&rdquo;</p>
