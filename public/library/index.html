    </header><p>Some excerpts from my reading log:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Norweigan Wood</em> by Haruki Murakami, February 2025: The dialogues are spot on. And the characters are hilarious. But the plot was quite predictable, and I was disgusted by Watanabe&rsquo;s view of Naoko.</li>
<li><em>Emil und Die Detektive</em> by Erich Kästner, February 2025</li>
<li><em>Against Empathy</em> by Paul Bloom, February 2025: If people had the same definition of empathy, surely there wouldn&rsquo;t be as much disagreement. Ultimately, I think most people would find PB&rsquo;s view on empathy pretty reasonable. However, the solution, replacing empathy with reason, does seem a bit cheap. PB also admits that we should not dispel of empathy altogether, so it&rsquo;s not clear to me what his alternative to an empathy-based morality would be.</li>
<li><em>Behave</em> by Robert Sapolsky, January 2025: Information overload. RS raises many interesting points, though. The chapters on the teenage brain and oxytocin were very insightful.</li>
<li><em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> by James Baldwin, January 2025: This seems like the kind of book which must be really hard to write, in the sense that you need to have seen a lot. Beautifully written.</li>
<li><em>Go Tell it on the Mountain</em> by James Baldwin, January 2025: The narrative was quite complex - not your &ldquo;wind down before bed&rdquo; kind of book. This book had more depth than <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>. It also touches on themes like religious fanaticism.</li>
<li><em>Going Clear</em> by Lawrence Wright, January 2025: An exhaustive history of scientology. On balance, a pretty depressing read.</li>
<li><em>How to Change Your Mind</em> by Michael Pollan, December 2024: A popular science book on the science of psychadelics. I felt like this book was needlessly long.</li>
<li><em>Being Mortal</em> by Atul Gawande, December 2024: A brilliant book, on a par with <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em>. AG is a phenomenal writer. This book disrupted my sleep schedule for a week.</li>
<li><em>Youth</em> by Leo Tolstoy, December 2024: So Tolstoy was just a normal person, after all.</li>
<li><em>Expanding Circles</em> by Peter Singer, December 2024: Although this book was a bit more technical than, say, <em>Animal Liberation</em> or <em>The Life You Can Save</em>, it was still pretty accessible. Intriguingly, PS doesn&rsquo;t comment on whether future beings should be included in &ldquo;the circle of moral consideration&rdquo;. Would be very curious to hear his take on this.</li>
<li><em>What We Owe the Future</em> by William MacAskill, November 2024: Overall, an interesting read. Sure, we should care about the future. But how much should we discount future generations&rsquo; wellbeing? Many questions are left hanging. I also thought WMA could have discussed the objections to longtermism in greater detail, rather than relegating them to an appendix.</li>
<li><em>White Nights</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky, November 2024: This entire story is basically a sketch of two characters. And that&rsquo;s OK. One doesn&rsquo;t need much else.</li>
<li><em>Letters to Milena</em> by Franz Kafka, October 2024: I picked up this book eager to get to know another side of FK. Not disappointed. But he writes about the same themes over and over again. Not the kind of book you binge read.</li>
<li><em>Emmys Teorem</em> av Julia Ravanis, Oktober 2024: Har inte stött på något liknande tidigare. Essä, populärvetenskap och biografi - allt i ett. Det är trevligt att umgås med JR och Emmy Noether.</li>
<li><em>The Perfume</em> by Patrick Süskind, September 2024: A brilliant book. PS has a good sense of humour.</li>
<li><em>Marina</em> por Carlos Ruiz Zafón, Septiembre 2024</li>
<li><em>Speak, Memory</em> by Vladimir Nabokov, August 2024: His style of writing is impeccable, as always. But if you want to learn more about the author’s life, you are in for a disappointment. The kind of background information one would ordinarily find in a biography is omitted. VN writes for himself and no one else.</li>
<li><em>The Elements of Murder: A History of Poison</em> by John Emsley, August 2024: The first chapter was alright. But the book did get quite repetitive after a while.</li>
<li><em>The Mandarins</em> by Simone de Beauvoir, August 2024: Hats off. The plot is very Hemingwayesque. However, this novel was not dry as, say, <em>A Moveable Feast</em> or <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. SB writes so well! The dialogues, which make up the meat of the novel, are fascinating. Moreover, this is not just a novel about fashionable people living novel-like lives; it is also a novel about post-war Paris and communism. A remarkable book.</li>
<li><em>Bergtagen</em> av Thomas Mann, Juli 2024: En roman om allt mellan himmel och jord. Känns lite grann som ett mellanting mellan en saga och en dödsallvarlig vuxenbok. Gillar att TM valde att skriva en bok på temat sjukdom. Och ändå känns boken väldigt inbjudande. Man blir uppslukad.</li>
<li><em>Idioten</em> av Fjodor Dostojevski, Juli 2024: Kändes som en skvallertidning på 900 sidor, men där berättaren gör narr av karaktärerna. Boken tar upp tidlösa teman, men den känns ändå ganska förlegad.</li>
<li><em>Stoner</em> by John Williams, June 2024: I like that the novel is about a “normal” person. But I also found the plot a bit dull at times.</li>
<li><em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> by Christopher Isherwood, June 2024: This is a lovely book! The characters all feel so real.</li>
<li><em>A Single Man</em> by Christopher Isherwood, June 2024: A remarkable novel. The style feels very much like stream of consciousness, but it is also very direct and matter-of-fact. A strange combination.</li>
<li><em>K</em> av Katarina Frostenson, Juni 2024: Förbryllad. Ett försvarstal? En dagboksroman? Vet inte hur man ska läsa den här boken. Men bra var den i alla fall.</li>
<li><em>A Moveable Feast</em> by Ernest Hemingway, May 2024: This book was a bit of a disappointment. If you merely want to know what happened back in the day, you may want to consult a historian instead.</li>
<li><em>Buddenbrooks</em> av Thomas Mann, April 2024: Lika bra som folk säger att den är. Berättartempot är högt, så man blir aldrig uttråkad.</li>
<li><em>Gertrud</em> av Herman Hesse, Mars 2024: En sorglig bok rakt igenom. HH. skriver så fint om musiken.</li>
<li><em>The Alignment Problem</em> by Brian Christian, March 2024: A balanced, well-written introduction to AI safety. It was very similar to <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em> or <em>Human Compatible</em>.</li>
<li><em>Superforecasting</em> by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner, February 2024: A thought-provoking book, but too wordy. The end of chapter 8 contains everything we need to know.</li>
<li><em>Dubbelgångaren</em> av Fjodor Dostojevskij, Februari 2024: Handlingen är helt spårad. Men det var uppfriskande att läsa något av FD. Till manusförfattaren som skulle försöka filmatisera den här boken - lycka till.</li>
<li><em>Letters to a Young Poet</em> by Rainer Maria Rilke, January 2024: It will take a lifetime to digest this.</li>
<li><em>Genomskinliga ting</em> av Vladimir Nabokov, Januari 2024: VN känns som en hundraårig tioåring: lekfull och insiktsfull på samma gång.</li>
<li><em>Algorithms to Live By</em> by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, June 2023: A lucid, well-written book. I never realised that algorithm design, complexity theory, optimisation, etc. could be <em>this</em> applied.</li>
<li><em>Student -64</em> av Gun-Britt Sundström, Juni 2023: Kul inslag om studentlivet. GBS skriver så träffsäkert.</li>
<li><em>The World of Yesterday</em> by Stefan Zweig, May 2023: A moving hommage to Europe and its people. One gets the impression that SZ is already an angel when writing.</li>
<li><em>Darkness at Noon</em> by Arthur Koestler, April 2023: Just as any good dystopia, this book was disturbing. Since the entire novel takes place inside a prison, I found this book more disturbing than 1984 and Brave New World.</li>
<li><em>The Gene</em> by Siddharta Mukherjee, March 2023: A well-written, thought-provoking book about the interplay between science and society. A most-read for fans of <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em>.</li>
