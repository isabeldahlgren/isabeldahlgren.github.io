<p>Once I was done with exams, it felt like getting my brain back. It&rsquo;s not just that you spend most of your day studying difficult subjects, leaving you with less time and willpower for other tasks. You also have to do cost-benefit analysis all the time. All.

<p>Slack is sometimes defined as having leftover resources. Intuitively, slack is like a buffer allowing you to absorb shocks better. We often speak of slack in the context of time and money. But to make things more visceral, imagine packing a bag. Having slack means having leftover space. There&rsquo;s no need to stuff your shoes with underwear, fold your clothes meticulously or pack things in a given order. You don&rsquo;t have to engage in trade-off thinking (&ldquo;If I leave my camera, I can fit my notebook and an umbrella&rdquo;). Having slack leads to a feeling of abundance.</p>
<p>Slack is trendy nowadays. The concepts of &ldquo;slow productivity&rdquo;, &ldquo;intentional work&rdquo; or &ldquo;anti-hustle culture&rdquo; are essentially about having more slack. There has also been some recent research into the benefits of slack.</p>
<p>Some companies have tried implementing four-day work weeks and measured productivity and employee wellbeing. The results? One <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biggest-trial-of-four-day-workweek-finds-workers-are-happier-and-feel-just/">survey paper</a> found that implementing four-day work weeks also made employees happier and healthier. This also agrees with my personal experience. I can only do good mathematics for at most 4-5 hours per day. After that, I need a long break.</p>
<p>As stressed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity:_Why_Having_Too_Little_Means_So_Much">Scarcity</a>, having slack also improves judgement. If you have little time or money, you tend to tunnel &ndash; neglecting anything which isn&rsquo;t immediately related to that resource (evolutionary baggage). There have also been numerous experiments showing that scarcity reduces mental bandwidth, i.e. intelligence and impulse control.</p>
<p>Perhaps slack is necessary for being happy too. Chronic stress and financial insecurity have very negative consequences on wellbeing.</p>
<h3 id="iii">III. <a href="#iii" class="hash">#</a></h3>
<p>To create slack, just say no.</p>
<p>Saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; is hard, though. Planning fallacy often leads us to take on too many tasks. While there are ways to overcome planning fallacy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, everything takes longer than expected by default. Even when you add a planning fallacy allowance. Moreover, saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; requires prioritising &ndash; cognitive effort.</p>
<p>To say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, remember that slack is the best thing ever. Here you can tap into your own quirks. For example, I often slip into a productivity-maxxximiser mindset, so I&rsquo;ll try reminding myself that slack makes me more productive. I also have a few idols, and creating slack also seems consistent with my goal of becoming more like them.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t just want to rely on mental habits. To create slack, I&rsquo;ve set myself the goal of &ldquo;working as an adult&rdquo; rather than a student. That is, I&rsquo;ll fix reasonable working hours, take Sundays off and treat breaks as a non-negotiables. These habits are all meant to protect slack. I also think digital hygiene helps create slack by making us more efficient. I&rsquo;m wary of email and Slack checking, I keep my phone out of reach when studying and I mostly keep my phone on silent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also tried identifying early warning signs that I need more slack. For example, when I have little slack, my message respond time increases from my targeted 24h to around three days<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I also tend to cut back on my reading before going to bed and clean my room less frequently. Silly, I know. But these are surprisingly effective indicators of my stress levels.</p>
<h3 id="iv">IV. <a href="#iv" class="hash">#</a></h3>
<p>It feels good having one&rsquo;s brain back. To do good work, you to be working at full capacity. This doesn&rsquo;t mean overexerting yourself. Rather, it means having slack. Good work &ndash; sustained efforts to solve hard problems effectively &ndash; comes from the feeling of slack.</p>
