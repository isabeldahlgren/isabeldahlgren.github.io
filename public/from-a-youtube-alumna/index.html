      <p>Random people on the Internet have played a huge role in my education. I&rsquo;m not just referring to my coursework at university, but also to &ldquo;Bildung&rdquo; more generally. I&rsquo;ve learned a ton by browsing StackOverflow threads and reading Medium articles. However, I&rsquo;ve probably learned the most from watching YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="learning-by-watching">Learning by watching <a href="#learning-by-watching" class="hash">#</a></h3>
<p>Above all, there&rsquo;s some really high-quality content out there. Nowadays there are full-time YouTubers, working on creating professional, meticulously edited videos. And some channels, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt</a>, are even ran by entire teams of illustrators and script-writers. Moreover, because anyone can record themselves and upload it to YouTube, we have world-class experts sharing their knowledge in YouTube lectures<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This means there are some truly remarkable YouTube videos. For example, here are comments from some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a> videos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped out in 10th grade 25 years ago and your videos have inspired me to go back to school.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You sir truly deserve an honorary doctorate - just for this video. Your impact to generations of confused engineering and math students will forever ripple through our society.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have a master&rsquo;s degree in mechanical engineering and I&rsquo;m starting to think I should redo my whole education from ground up searching for this kind of intuitive knowledge. It&rsquo;s absurd that I find out explanations which are as intuitive as this one so late in my life. I&rsquo;m blown away completely! I mean how many bits of information have we stumbled upon during our formal education failing to see how they elegantly relate to each other and form a bigger picture&hellip;oh my!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, videos tend to be more attention-grabbing than articles. Although most people are unable to read while cooking or brushing their teeth, they can watch videos. So getting started learning has never required less willpower: just search &ldquo;Introduction to&hellip;&rdquo; on YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="learning-to-watch">Learning to watch <a href="#learning-to-watch" class="hash">#</a></h3>
<p>Of course, YouTube isn&rsquo;t designed to be a learning platform. But there ways of optimising for a better learning experience.</p>
<p>The first step is to recognise that YouTube tries maximising user retention. This is a feature, not a bug. It means we can design our YouTube interface such that we end up binge watching informative videos about topics we care about. Here are some ways of achieving this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Train your algorithm</strong>: in your YouTube feed, take 2 seconds to press &ldquo;Not interested&rdquo; whenever something irrelevant pops up. It pays off - I find the YouTube algorithm to be surprisingly sensitive to my feedback.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Keep separate accounts</strong>: on a similar note, I have two Google accounts: my main account, and my secondary account. I&rsquo;ll use my main account for watching &ldquo;useful&rdquo; content, while I&rsquo;ll log onto my secondary account for, well, everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Block channels</strong>: use <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/support/how-to/allow-youtube-channel/">ColdTurkey</a> to block certain YouTube channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second step is to recognise the limits of just watching videos. There&rsquo;s a reason we don&rsquo;t abandon more traditional media altogether. When reading a book, I find it much easier recognising when I&rsquo;m confused. However, after finishing a video, I sometimes find myself completely lost and unable to tell where I stopped following. Moreover, whenever I have a physical textbook, I&rsquo;ll often refer back to chapters I&rsquo;ve finished, just to refresh my memory. Here are two partial fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media notes plugin</strong>: the <a href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=media-notes">Media Notes</a> plugin for Obsidian is a real game-changer. It allows you to watch YouTube videos from inside Obsidian and take notes with timestamps. When doing this, I seem to engage more with the material. Taking physical notes while watching YouTube is a bit overkill, so this seems like a good compromise.</li>
<li><strong>Rewatch your favourite videos</strong>: it&rsquo;s easy ending up only consuming new content, just because the YouTube landing page is filled with new videos. But it&rsquo;s worth saving your favourite videos to playlists and rewatching them later.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I discussed above, there are some hacks for a better learning experience. However, YouTube could also design their platform differently. They could e.g. develop distraction-free mode, enabling the user to remove shorts, ads or sponsored content. From a technical perspective, it&rsquo;s doable. But we could also go beyond ordinary videos. For example, Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen have explored ways of incorporating an element of spaced repetition in videos, making for a more interactive learning experience; see <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/#mnemonic-video">here</a>. In general, I&rsquo;m excited about integrating modern technology with education.</p>
<p>All this said, I’d like to thank the strangers who have played - and continue to play - an important role in my education.</p>
