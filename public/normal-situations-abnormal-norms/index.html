    </header><p>Most people lead a comfortable 9-5 life. You go to work, work away, go home, sometimes seeing friends or engaging in extracurriculars. Even so, sometimes you find yourself in unusual social situations, situations where a first-timer wouldn&rsquo;t know how to behave. Here are some normal situations with abnormal social norms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flights:</strong> On a 12-hour flight, you find a cross section of the population bored, tired and without Internet. In this willpower-reduced state, snobs dress in sweatpants and workaholics watch thrashy feel-good movies. A surprising number of people try napping<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, while others strike up conversations with strangers.</li>
<li><strong>Dates:</strong> It&rsquo;s common for people taking steps to get to know new people, for example by attending local meet-ups; however, friend-seekers rarely try getting to know others well. Dates are among the few situations where people deliberately try building deep connections. Think about it: the purpose of a date is for two people, usually strangers, to become romantic partners. Pretty remarkable, right? Even more remarkable is that it sometimes works.</li>
<li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Alcohol creates a form of social anarchy. Moderately tipsy people are amusing &ndash; they&rsquo;re a bit like children, candid and ignorant of social norms, though they enjoy discussing grown-up topics.</li>
<li><strong>Work interviews:</strong> A work interview is nothing at all like an ordinary conversation, despite appearances; it&rsquo;s like an improv play where the interviewee tries selling themself and the interviewer maintains a poker face. The interviewee presents themself as the ideal employee: competent, reliable and a good coffee machine conversationalist<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Music festivals:</strong> During music festivals, thousands of sweaty people packed like sardines scream in unison while jumping up and down. Though they&rsquo;re strangers, they share a sense of camaraderie, sometimes even sharing food and belongings<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Cult?</li>
<li><strong>Summer camps:</strong> There are summer camps for kids as well as adults, though the latter are sometimes called &lsquo;retreats&rsquo; or &lsquo;get-aways&rsquo;. The goal of most summer camps is for a group of strangers to pursue a common interest together and make new friends. Being in a remote place helps create a space for intimacy: the camp participants tacitly agree that &lsquo;what gets said here stays here&rsquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Military service:</strong> Life in the military is famously totalitarian: it&rsquo;s all about obeying your superiors. And if you do mandatory military service, you&rsquo;re normally at the bottom of the pecking order. In no other setting is there such a clear hierarchy, and in no other setting is outright bullying socially acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all time-bound activities disconnected from everyday life, usually physically or by means of clothing, with extraordinary social norms. This makes them good settings for people-watching. Why study &lsquo;man in a state of nature&rsquo; &ndash; an impossibility anyway &ndash; if you can study &lsquo;man in a state of society&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is telling of our society.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>Any weaknesses of the interviewee are, naturally, just their virtues in excess: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m somewhat stubborn, but that&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;m so driven.&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Every music festival has a bit of Woodstock to it.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
