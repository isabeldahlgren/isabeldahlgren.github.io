    </header><p>Nowadays, you can spend all your waking hours consuming valuable information. Pretty remarkable, when you come to think of it. Hint: AirPods Pro.</p>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re doing something not demanding your full attention, you can always turn on a podcast. You can listen to podcasts when commuting, working out or cooking<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Technically, you could have done something similar 50 years ago using a walkman. But it have been very high-effort. Today, we have dedicated podcast apps and noise-cancelling, wireless earplugs. As a result, the podcast industry is rapidly growing in size. If you sample 100 young adults from the street in an urban area, a substantial number of them might be listening to podcasts.</p>
<h3 id="i">I.</h3>
<p>In school, they teach you analytic reading. But they don&rsquo;t teach you analytic podcast-listening. By this, I mean podcast-listening to learn about new ideas. Deliberate listening, as opposed to just hearing.</p>
<p>Analytic podcast-listening is very different from analytic reading. While I find it harder following the structure of an argument in podcast form, the podcast medium has other benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Podcasts are low-effort way of discovering new ideas. Because there are so many podcast hours in the day, you can afford to explore more novel content. I&rsquo;m pickier when selecting books to read, since it&rsquo;s a bigger investment.</li>
<li>Podcasts can have a very high idea density. Because most podcasts are at most one hour, podcast guests are forced to focus on their key insights.</li>
<li>Podcasts are great for stress testing ideas. Someone might make a convincing argument in a blog post but fail to defend their views in a podcast. Similarly, you might come away from a podcast feeling like a podcast guest is completely unreasonable. Suspicious!</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it seems worth practising analytic podcast-listening. If you listen to podcasts 2h daily, this might make a huge difference.</p>
<h3 id="ii">II.</h3>
<p>Before we get into strategies for analytic podcast-listening, I&rsquo;d like to stress the need to prioritise. If you feed a neural network bad data, you won&rsquo;t get good results &ndash; no matter how efficient the training process. My podcast taste, in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>I mostly listen to podcasts with transcripts, so I can easily refer back to interesting parts of the conversation. For my favourite episodes, I&rsquo;ll chuck the transcript into a large language model and have it summarise the key points. Ideally, the show notes also contain time stamps and further references. In this respect, <a href="https://hearthisidea.com/">Hear This Idea</a> and the <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/">80,000 hours podcast</a> do an excellent job.</li>
<li>I find it quite valuable listening to podcasts with authors of books or articles I&rsquo;ve read. These podcast episodes serve as good refreshers. This point also relates to the above point about stress testing ideas.</li>
<li>I also like listening to blog posts in podcast form. While I don&rsquo;t retain as much information as after reading the post, I usually get the gist. Above all, listening to blog posts helps me decide which posts to read later.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iii">III.</h3>
<p>Here are some strategies for analytic podcast-listening<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have some system for saving podcasts that resonated with you. Re-listen to your favourite episodes, much as you&rsquo;d reread your favourite books. Here&rsquo;s my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/77yvdL2OH9bKwit9SNECGN?si=9b726b7d35174fb3">podcast shelf</a>.</li>
<li>Similarly, keep an anti-library for podcasts. I have a list of podcasts recommended by others.</li>
<li>Create voice memos to capture your thoughts. If I&rsquo;m on the go, I might dictate thoughts and have an LLM convert my yapping into bullet points later.</li>
<li>There are dedicated podcast apps which allow you to capture segments of podcasts. I&rsquo;ve played around with some of these, and I&rsquo;m quite impressed by how well they work.</li>
<li>Work with playback speed. Here it&rsquo;s useful to think in terms of exploration and exploitation. If it&rsquo;s a high-quality episode, I&rsquo;ll usually listen at a 0.8x speed. While listening to podcasts, I&rsquo;m usually multitasking, so I need additional processing time. If I&rsquo;m listening to a new show, I&rsquo;ll turn up the speed to 2x.</li>
<li>If you have a smartwatch, put it to good use! The most valuable feature of my Apple Watch has been the ability to rewind podcast episodes by 15s.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iv">IV.</h3>
<p>Podcasts play a big role in my process for updating beliefs. Podcasts, along with conversations with others, are my main methods for &ldquo;gaining surface area&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I only began thinking in terms of analytic podcast-listening quite recently. Ultimately, I&rsquo;m realising that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;just&rdquo; a matter of being more intentional about the content you consume. But it probably helps having a funky name for it.</p>

<p>Listening to podcasts at all times is a bad idea, though.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
