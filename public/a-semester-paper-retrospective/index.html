      <p>This is a follow-up on my <a href="https://isabeldahlgren.github.io/two-results-from-probabilistic-number-theory/">previous article</a>, where I share some thoughts on the process of writing a semester paper.</p>
<p>Lots of disclaimers: this is all very specific to my experience: the topic of my paper, my supervisor, my workload in others courses, etc. Also, I&rsquo;m certainly in no position to give advice on mathematical writing; these are just reflections on what worked and what didn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<h3 id="on-writing-papers">On writing papers <a href="#on-writing-papers" class="hash">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are some principles for writing mathematical papers that I tried to follow, mostly based on feedback from my supervisors. I received plenty of useful feedback, but here are the points I found the most useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-down exposition: concretely, this meant explaining how all lemmas would come together before proving each lemma. This minimises the amount of task-switching for the reader. In addition, this helps motivate the lemmas and allows the reader to decide which parts to skip.</li>
<li>Short proofs: as a rule of thumb, I tried breaking up proofs in such a way that proofs of subresults would fit on one page. To my surprise, in most cases, this was doable.</li>
<li>Reducing cognitive load: a piece of feedback I received from Vivian was to try reducing the cognitive load of the reader; it&rsquo;s also a major theme <a href="https://ngtriant.github.io/notes/practical_suggestions_for_mathematical_writing.pdf">here</a>. This idea really resonated with me. Concretely, this meant doing things like:
<ul>
<li>Restating parameters: for example, one might go &ldquo;Recalling that $X = \text{definition of }X$, we obtain&hellip;&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;By our choice of $X$, &hellip;.&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Creating indices of notation and parameters: very relevant if your proof is notation-heavy.</li>
<li>More descriptive text: rather than writing &ldquo;we have&rdquo; or &ldquo;thus&rdquo; before a computation, I tried describing which device I was using. Mentioning that you&rsquo;re using, say, a union bound doesn&rsquo;t take up much additional space on the page, and it makes for a better reading experience. (Also, if you&rsquo;re doing analytic number theory, you need more alternatives to &ldquo;we have&rdquo;!)</li>
<li>Indicating what won&rsquo;t be proved: in order to keep the report at a reasonable length, I had to omit the proofs of some preliminary results and avoid repeating similar arguments. I tried making this clear to the reader, so I wouldn&rsquo;t leave them hanging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What I would have found useful: initially, I didn&rsquo;t know how many details to include. If I&rsquo;d try explaining all details I&rsquo;d struggled with when reading the proof, the text would be too verbose! Vivian had some good advice here: aim for the level of detail you&rsquo;d liked when reading it for the first time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For future papers, I&rsquo;m considering trying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Including dependency graphs: although a bit unconventional, these can be tremendously helpful for long and convoluted proofs. See e.g. my piece on <a href="https://isabeldahlgren.github.io/hunting-dependencies/">dependencies</a>.</li>
<li>Commenting on dead ends: a few words about why the naïve approach fails can be very illuminating. This can help motivate the use of some very complicated tool and potentially save the reader a lot of time. While remarks on failed proof attempts can sometimes be found in the &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo; section of a paper, I think like they aren&rsquo;t given as much attention as they deserve (an unfortunate instance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias">publication bias</a>).</li>
<li>Reducing cognitive load, even more: if I&rsquo;d kept this in mind during the entire writing process, I think I&rsquo;d done a few things differently. For further ideas on how to reduce cognitive load, I highly recommend the previously mentioned <a href="https://ngtriant.github.io/notes/practical_suggestions_for_mathematical_writing.pdf">piece</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lessons">Lessons <a href="#lessons" class="hash">#</a></h3>
<p>If I were to write a thesis or paper again, I would have done a lot differently. Here are the main changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do it in one go: it would have been much more enjoyable and efficient doing most of the semester paper within a much shorter period of time. If you&rsquo;re trying to understand an involved argument, you need all the relevant notions floating around in your brain at the same time. Don&rsquo;t read one lemma per week.</li>
<li>Request additional feedback: if your supervisor is kind to offer additional feedback, that&rsquo;s extremely valuable.</li>
<li>As soon as you get it, typeset: you&rsquo;ll have to do it anyway, and you might as well do it when you understand it. This also helps corroborate your understanding.</li>
<li>Know when to ask for help: I wasn&rsquo;t sure how long it was reasonable for me to be stuck on a particular passage before asking for help, and I know supervisors have different preferences here. Trivial fix: ask your supervisor &ldquo;For how long should I be stuck before asking for help?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Knowing how to ask for help: at first, I&rsquo;d ask questions during meetings. But I soon began emailing a list of questions to my supervisor a few days before our check-ins. That way, I think we both got more out of the meetings.</li>
<li>Typesetting takes time: it seems to be a law of nature that TeX:ing always takes longer than expected. This happened as I was writing my bachelor thesis too. Despite having a pretty sophisticated NeoVim LaTeX setup with snippets, typesetting took twice as long as I expected. For future papers, I&rsquo;ll probably go with <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>.</li>
