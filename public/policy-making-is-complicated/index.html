Here, I&rsquo;ll list some intuition pumps for the difficulty of policy-related questions. For concreteness, I&rsquo;ll focus on the first of the three above topics, nuclear power in Germany.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More than a wing flap</strong>: Recall the butterfly effect: a butterfly&rsquo;s wing flap can cause a tornado elsewhere. How about the choice-of-energy-supply effect?</li>
<li><strong>Defining justice</strong>: Are there conflicting interests? Then we have to define justice first. Wonderful. This would involve solving a big part of political philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>Multilayer forecasting</strong>: Answering this question involves forecasting the effects of two hypothetical scenarios (the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; scenarios). But forecasting is basically a full-time job. Forecasters need to identify relevant parameters, estimate them, steelman opposing views, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy student</strong>: You could easily write a master thesis on this topic. A master thesis is 30 ETCS. Feel the credits!</li>
<li><strong>Headcount</strong>: There&rsquo;s probably a good number of people working on exactly on this issue. Sum over people in special commissions, the government, in academia, in think tanks, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Hard optimisation</strong>: The ideal energy source emits zero carbon, works all year round, is cheap, doesn&rsquo;t produce toxic nuclear waste, etc. This leads to an infinite-dimensional optimisation problem. Worse, the loss functions need not be smooth and differentiable.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond EXPSpace</strong>: If the travelling salesman problem is NP-hard, then what on earth is this optimisation problem even?</li>
<li><strong>Non-computable</strong>: If the halting problem is uncomputable, is there any hope of answering this question?</li>
<li><strong>Inference time</strong>: Imagine prompting a reasoning language model, say GPT-5, to write a nuanced 100-page report on the question. What would be the inference time?</li>
<li><strong>Going broke</strong>: Alternative formulation, so you really feel it: Imagine prompting a reasoning language model, say GPT-5, to write a nuanced 100-page report on the question. Suppose you were billed on a per-token basis. What would be the price?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, policy is complicated. What does this mean in practise?</p>
<p>It seems important to distinguish between &ldquo;thinking for fun&rdquo; and &ldquo;thinking for truth&rdquo;. I enjoy thinking about hard problems &ndash; that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons I do mathematics. But if I&rsquo;m thinking for truth in a domain outside my expertise<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t spend more than 1% of my time coming up with a prior. It will be very weak, anyway. Things are complicated, remember?</p>
<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;ll try outsourcing as much as possible to experts, resisting the urge to &ldquo;attempt every problem&rdquo;. My job should reduce to aggregating expert opinions. Ideally, I could ask an LLM to fill in a table with expert opinions and their respective confidence levels, so I could just take a weighted average.</p>
<p>In a very backward way, internalising that things are complicated makes my life much simpler.</p>
