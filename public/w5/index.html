    </header><p>Opinionated people can be really annoying. Wherever they go, they try convincing you of their ideas. If you have an opinionated uncle, the Christmas dinner might be ruined by a bitter argument. I&rsquo;ve certainly had bad experiences with a dinner-table conversations turning into feuds. For this reason, I used to try having fewer opinions. I implicitly assumed this meant being more liberal and open-minded. Well, no.</p>
<p>Actually, there are plenty of benefits of actively trying to form more opinions. Even about topics you don&rsquo;t know particularly well. If you learn with a view towards arguing, then you&rsquo;ll pay closer attention to the material. I think this has to do with anchoring. If you pick a stance, even at random, you&rsquo;ll be more emotionally invested. Holden Karnofsky summarised it neatly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By doing this [trying to have a hypothesis and rearticulating it whenever it changes], I try to <strong>continually focus my reading on the goal of forming a bottom-line view, rather than just “gathering information.”</strong> I think this makes my investigations more focused and directed, and the results easier to retain. I consider this approach to be <strong>probably the single biggest difference-maker between &ldquo;reading a ton about lots of things, but retaining little&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiently developing a set of views on key topics and retaining the reasoning behind them.&rdquo;</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, chatting with people with strong opinions can also be fun. Say you&rsquo;re at a cocktail party. Small talk can be quite tiring, at least after a couple of hours. In this situation, I&rsquo;ll gladly talk to people trying to persuade me of their ideas. Or say you&rsquo;re hosting friends for dinner, and a friend explains her take on a topic you all like.</p>
<p>At this point, one might ask what prevents us from forming more opinions. Here are the reasons that stand out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fear of being wrong</strong>: I think many people, whether they recognise it or not, resort to some kind of agnosticism for fear of being wrong. However, recognising you&rsquo;re wrong just means you&rsquo;re updating your beliefs. It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal. So stick your neck out.</li>
<li><strong>No one seems to care</strong>: If you go on to study a technical subject, you aren&rsquo;t encouraged to voice your opinions. You can&rsquo;t have opinions about solutions to PDEs - either you&rsquo;re right or wrong. Unless you hang out with people who like arguing, you&rsquo;ll have fewer opportunities to discuss your beliefs.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of confidence</strong>: Many people think they aren&rsquo;t entitled to hold an opinion since they aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;qualified&rdquo;. This is true for areas in which there&rsquo;s a clear distinction between experts and non-experts. But I have a hunch that we sometimes use this as an excuse for not looking into an issue. I&rsquo;ve certainly been guilty of doing this. Anyway, I think there&rsquo;s a middle ground here: if you don&rsquo;t know all the technical details, just adjust your confidence levels.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>: Forming opinions about some topics might be really, really hard. For example, predicting technological progress is notoriously difficult. However, uncertainty isn&rsquo;t a good reason to not make up one&rsquo;s mind, especially if it&rsquo;s a pressing problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as one has some &ldquo;epistemic etiquette&rdquo; - being prepared to change your beliefs in the light of new evidence, and not taking everything so personally - having more opinions seems like a good thing. I&rsquo;m currently trying to build the habit of always having a working hypothesis whenever I learn something new. Having more opinions makes you feel more like part of the world, rather than as a bystander.</p>
